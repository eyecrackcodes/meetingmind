-- Bootstrap Admin User for MeetingMind
-- This script will help you create the first admin user to manage approvals

-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. First, sign up normally through your app with the email you want to be admin
-- 2. Copy that email address and replace 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE' below
-- 3. Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- 4. Refresh your app - you'll now have admin access!

-- REPLACE THIS EMAIL with the email you used to sign up:
\set admin_email 'eyecrackcodes@gmail.com'

-- The script will find your user and make them admin
DO $$

    admin_user_id UUID;
